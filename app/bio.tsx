			I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I&apos;m passionate about building web applications, developing efficient backend systems, and learning new technologies. Currently, I&apos;m seeking opportunities in software engineering where I can apply my skills, gain exposure to new technologies and frameworks, and contribute to innovative projects.
