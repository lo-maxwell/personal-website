			Psyduck is a Water-type Pok√©mon known for its distinctive yellow, duck-like appearance and its perpetual headache, which triggers its psychic powers. Often seen holding its head in confusion, Psyduck is both comical and endearing, as it struggles to control its powerful yet unpredictable abilities. When its headache becomes too intense, Psyduck unleashes bursts of psychic energy that can have devastating effects, though it usually has no memory of what happens afterward. Despite its somewhat clumsy and absent-minded nature, Psyduck has a loyal following for its charm and unique blend of cuteness and mystery.
